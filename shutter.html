        <h1 class="project-title">Shudder</h1>
        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Product Design</h2>
        <p>Shudder is a subscription horror genre video streaming service operated by AMC Networks, with a library of short and feature films, television series, documentaries, podcasts, and original content as well. Since I could spend more time than you have discussing media service strategies, and even truncated this page is going to be too long, I’m going to get right at it - </p>
        <p>The key differentiator between Shudder and similar services is the human-curated library. And to explain what that really means, I have to wax poetic. I grew up with video stores; my friends and I would ride bikes to go rent movies we weren’t supposed to, staying up way too late fueled by Jolt. And we all experienced the video store clerk not just renting us a movie, but recommending what movie to watch, and why. Why we should watch that title with the bad box art, it, why it was important - telling us the back story, or behind the scenes production tidbit that enriched the film - giving us some context that made a less that perfect film great. And now, Shudder is our new video clerk.</p>
        <p>
          For this proposed redesign I focused on three things: a better experience for existing users, an improved signed out experience for potential users, and a way to extend the service when we’re off the couch and not watching a screen. And to make it seem real, with limited structural changes - “on the cheap” so to speak.

        <h2 class="project-subtitle">The Voice of Shudder</h2>
        <p>This redesign is about opening up the layout a bit for more text so that context can bubble up to the surface. To do this I’ve grouped elements into repeating sections, as seen below, into templates that pull data from existing categories. These templates can be arranged randomly to keep visual interest, and work not only on home, but subsequent secondary and tertiary category pages. </p>
        <p>
          The main carousel received a bit of love too - I’ve added short video previews where there were once static images, because, hey, it looks good and sells a film. I tightened up the type treatment, grouped the controls together and creating a “peek” for the next item in the queue. The benefit of this is in keeping the main image/video tighter, preventing scaling issues when the browser window is enlarged.

        <h2 class="project-subtitle">The Signed Out Experience</h2>
        <p>Currently when potential customers visit the site, content isn’t hidden behind a pay wall, and visitors are encouraged to browse (and find value). Shudder currently offers a free live stream of titles from their library, though it’s currently a bit buried (well below the fold), there’s no explicit indication it’s free (differentiated from other content in that regard), or inform visitors what’s currently live streaming.</p>
        <p>I decided to prioritize this: when a user is visiting or signed out, the free stream becomes the first item in the main carousel. The call to action becomes watch free instead of play, and the placeholder image/video is pulled from the title that’s currently streaming. Additionally, when the media player is launched, an advertisement for the service plays before picking up the live stream. A 15-second ad isn’t too much to ask for free movies and tv shows.</p>
        <p>
          The first section below the carousel is an editorial showcase of Shudder exclusives, since they’re, well, exclusive to Shudder. And seriously,  they do get great exclusives. Mayhem and Dead Shack? For reals, go watch, when you’re done here of course ;)

        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Off the couch </h2>
        <p>I wanted to find a way to extend the service to customers when they’re not on the couch watching screens; when they’re driving to work, commuting on the bus, on a flight, or even staying at that cabin far in the woods with no cell service. There are three things Shudder needs to reach users in these scenarios: a library of audio content (for those drivers and runners), the ability to store media locally on devices, and to permit the media player to operate while the device’s screen is locked. </p>
        <p>To the first point, Shudder does offer a limited selection of podcasts, but there isn’t enough audio content to build that engagement loop with customers. Shudder’s current audio library could be rapidly expanded with exclusive content with the introduction of audio books. Yes, books on tape, haha.</p>
        <p>Production costs would be kept low by using well known intellectual property that is in public domain - Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the works of Poe, and even some HP Lovecraft, for example. That and a microphone, it’s all set (haha, I know, not really).</p>
        <p>
          There’s a need to make these audio books visually interesting on screen as well. I believe a mixture of illustration and animation as the solution, as illustrated in the video below (coming soon).
